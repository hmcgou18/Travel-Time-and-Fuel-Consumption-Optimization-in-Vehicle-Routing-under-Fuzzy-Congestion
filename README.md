# Travel-Time-and-Fuel-Consumption-Optimization-in-Vehicle-Routing-under-Fuzzy-Congestion
This repository includes all the codes used in my master thesis project "Travel Speed and Fuel Consumption Optimization in Traffic Routing under Fuzzy congestion".  All codes are run in R.

"Data Preparation" contains the code for preparation of the data, which can be found at https://data.austintexas.gov/Transportation-and-Mobility/Radar-Traffic-Counts/i626-g7ub. This code can take a while to run so it is recomended to download "austin_data.Rdata" trough this repository, as this contains the ready data set.

"System and functions" contains the needed packages, the fuzzy inference system, and the function definitions used in the vehicle routing.

"Vehicle routing" contains the code for the tests without forecast.

"Forecast vehicle routing" contains the code for the tests with forecast.
